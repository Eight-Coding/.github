# Eight Coding

Eight Coding is a project-based learning community for beginners who want to learn by building.

We focus on:
- Hands-on coding with real projects
- Git and GitHub collaboration
- Exploring different tech stacks
- Working as a team, just like in real dev environments

## Who Is This For?
- Total beginners who want to start coding
- Learners tired of tutorials with no practical experience
- Anyone who wants to grow by building and contributing

## How It Works
- We pick projects as a community
- You join a role (UI, backend, docs, etc.)
- We use GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and branches to build together
- You learn real dev skills in a safe, beginner-friendly space

## Project Structure
Each project lives in its own repo under this organization.
